### Web crawling without DOM Parsing


#### Flow
- check Request and Response with Google developer tools
- Most pages use GET method and you would know what parameter needs for Reqeust (check URL)
- With GOT library, request data.
- filtering response that I need.
- Done!


#### Question
- Can I call this Web Crawling...? 

#### Anyway, Result
